# String Handling Practice
 *by Using String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer*
 
 1. WAP to print any given inputString in following format.
       
        Output
  
        index:  0    1   2   3   4   
        chars:  H    e   l   l   o
        
        Every character is seprated by tab use ```"\t"``` for inserting tab.
   2. WAP to print substring of a given inputString by using ```String substring(int index)```. Accept inputString and index from user.
   
   3. WAP to accept inputString from user and replace all the vowels by *, by using ```String replace(char oldChar, char newChar)```.
   
   4. Modify the above program so that:
        1. first occurred vowel will be replaced by *.
        2. Second occurred vowel will be replaced by ^.
        3. Third occurred vowel will be replaced by !.
        repeat the above process fro all occurred vowels.
   
   5. WAP to replace all the occurrence of given subString from the inputString. --- (**search library function for the task from the java docs** by using the link [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html]).
